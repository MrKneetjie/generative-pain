        <h1>A Redemption Story!</h1>
        <p>Your friend tells you to mint Apes, you tell them NFTs are worthless JPEGs.</p>
        <p>Your Dad texts you to buy SOL, you call him a boomer and remind him to take his meds.</p>
        <p>Your cousin recommends DOGE, you laugh and tell him to read the Bitcoin whitepaper.</p>
        <p>What happens next is the most common emotion felt by all those who embark on their perilous crypto journeys...</p>
        <p id="huge">PAIN.</p>
        <p>Selling too early. Buying too late. Getting rugged. Minting the wrong NFT.</p>
        <p>Right when things finally start to look up, and you think you’ve got it all figured out, the rug is pulled and you’re back to square one.</p>
        <p>Liquidated. Bag holding valueless governance tokens. Trapped in immovable JPEGs.</p>
        <p>We don’t know if you’ve made money or lost money in crypto, but one thing we can assure you is that you’ve felt lots and lots of <span id="big">PAIN</span>.</p>
        <p>This is the path we’ve chosen.</p>
        <p>In the end, we have no-one to blame but ourselves.</p>
